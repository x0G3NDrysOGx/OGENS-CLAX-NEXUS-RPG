Overview
Game Type: Text-based RPG | Windows Command Line | RNG D2+D5/D2+D3
Author: Developed by Cody L Morgan
Version: 7.0

Welcome to OGENS CLAX NEXUS - D2+D5 & D2+D3, a minimalist yet rich command-line RPG set in a mysterious underground realm. Brave shifting paths, collect arcane artifacts and relics, and rise through the Nexus by surviving traps, recruiting companions, and leveling up. Each playthrough is unique thanks to randomized characters and branching events driven by dice rolls. In D2+D3, a two-sided die (1–2) and a three-sided die (1–3) are rolled, mapping to a 2x3 grid for outcomes 1–6. In D2+D5, a two-sided die (1–2) and a five-sided die (1–5) map to a 2x5 grid for outcomes 1–10. A companion’s luck adjusts the outcome, creating dynamic challenges and rewards.

Dice & Modifiers
Events are based on a D2+D3 roll mapped to 1–6 outcomes with a Luck Modifier:

D2: 1–2, D3: 1–3
Outcome = (D2-1)*3 + D3
LuckMod = Companion Luck - 5
AdjustedRoll = Outcome + LuckMod (clamped to 1–6)
        
Outcomes depend on the Adjusted Roll:

Low rolls (2, 3, 4): Damage (-10 to -17+Strength player health, -10 to -17+Strength companion health), minimal XP (0–1)
Mid rolls (5): Items (Potions in Paths 3 and 4, Charms in Path 2, Relics in Paths 2 and 4), moderate XP (5)
High rolls (1, 6): Artifacts, score boosts (6–8+level), health gains (+2 player, +2 companion), high XP (5–10), Relics (Paths 2 and 4), Keys (Paths 3 and 4)
For D2+D5, rolls are mapped to 1–10 outcomes:

D2: 1–2, D5: 1–5
Outcome = (D2-1)*5 + D5
LuckMod = Companion Luck - 5
AdjustedRoll = Outcome + LuckMod (clamped to 1–10)
        
Outcomes depend on the Adjusted Roll:

Negative outcomes (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10): Damage (-12 to -17 + Strength for player and companion), minimal XP (0–1)
Mid-tier outcomes (e.g., 5, 7): Items (Potions, Keys, Relics), Health (+4), moderate XP (5–8)
Positive outcomes (e.g., 1, 3, 9): Artifacts (+1), Score (6–10 + level), Health (+4), high XP (8–10)
