Dice & Modifiers
Events are based on a D2+D5 roll mapped to 1–10 outcomes with Luck Modifier:

D2: 1–2, D5: 1–5
Outcome = (D2-1)*5 + D5
LuckMod = Companion Luck - 5
AdjustedRoll = Outcome + LuckMod (clamped to 1–10)
        
Outcomes depend on the Adjusted Roll:

Negative outcomes (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10): Damage (-12 to -17 + Strength for player and companion), minimal XP (0–1)
Mid-tier outcomes (e.g., 5, 7): Items (Potions, Keys, Relics), Health (+4), moderate XP (5–8)
Positive outcomes (e.g., 1, 3, 9): Artifacts (+1), Score (6–10 + level), Health (+4), high XP (8–10)
